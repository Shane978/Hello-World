# Hello-World
Learning and becoming familiar with Git.

Learnign to become a developer and the tools that are needed.
Also trying to have different resources of information. My goal is to become
a decent develor with programs such as C3, PHP, Python, and others. The best way
I know to do that is by failing foward.
